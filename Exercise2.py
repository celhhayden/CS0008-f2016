# Description    : Starting with Python, Chapter 2, Exercise 2
#
# notes  : exercise asks to find value for projected sale
#
# the book gave no value so I used a random amount (1,000) to describe the total sales
total_sales = 1000
# for these next two lines I found an example from the book and decided to do something like it
annual_profit = total_sales * .23
print("Annual profit:",annual_profit)
