
For this program, a lot of if-elif-else statements were of course used
to complete the task.  I had to find a way to have the user input a unit
of measurement, the distance, and gas and then use if statements to
make sure the right equations were used to make the right conversions.
After getting the conversions and such, I had to apply multiple formats to
print the information in an organized chart structure.  I looked in
the book for formatting assistance and applied what I found to make
the information presented nicely.
