For the code, there were a lot of errors that came up that I had to work
around, sometimes resulting in a few more lines than I would hope would
have been necessary.  I ended up creating three functions and used multiple
loop functions in order to parse out the info that was required.  The way
I ended up getting the formating was actually a bit of luck mixed with help
from the book, but I believe after getting it I better understand some of
the functions I used.  I also made sure to include plenty of notes along with
certain portions of the code, since as I mentioned earlier there were some
not-so-shortcuts I had to take in order for my code to work.  Minus some
frustrating syntx errors and the other formatting errors the coding went 
pretty smoothly.
